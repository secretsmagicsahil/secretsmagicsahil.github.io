I have always had a knack for Math, ever since my mom made me count the products and prices of items at Pick 'n Pay. Thank you mommy!
<br> <br>
I love mixing Math and a little bit of fun and I aim to end the stigma of Math being boring! I have continually received high distinctions and top student awards for high school Math and was able to excel at Advanced Programme Math too.
<br> <br>
I also have a nice smile (see picture to the left).

WORK ON THIS! I’ve always loved Mathematics since I was small (well, smaller). 
<br> <br>
I’ve always loved how we were able to find patterns in this random universe that we live in. We are able to accomplish so much because of Maths!
<br> <br>
Unfortunately Mathematics has gotten a negative stigma due to the poor way it’s taught in education. People tend to view it as a “study” subject and not one where you actually explore.
