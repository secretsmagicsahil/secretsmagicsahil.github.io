<p>
The Math Guys was founded by two, frankly, Math and comedic geniuses - Adam Crafford and Sahil Samlal. Both Adam and Sahil excelled in their schooling Mathematics careers. Their battle lasted until the end of Matric, where they both received 90%+ distinctions for Mathematics, among many others. Finally, they put their differences aside and started using their powers for good
<br> <br>
In his Matric year, Sahil Samlal was awarded the top Mathematics students and Advanced Programme Mathematics student. He was awarded the "Dequaviousek" medal of bravery for saving a child from an erupting volcano. A true national hero.
<br> <br>
Adam was that child.
